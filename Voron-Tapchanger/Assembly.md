Insert the heat-set inserts, they need to be flush with the surface and at a reasonably accurate angle.
Use the positioning jig for vertical insert direction.

Screw in the bearings, using 8-10 mm screws and washers. They should lock in quite tight, optionally can add locktite for extra safety.

Glue in the magnet. It should be flush or slightly recessd.

# The toolhead plate

(Round rods) Use a 3mm drill bit on slow speed to clear out any loose overhangs from the rod holes.

Cut rods to length and push in as far as they go.
I'm adding some PVA glue to the holes to hold them but still be able to remove if needed.

Thread in 2 m8 socket head screws at the bottom. All the way in should be too loose, back up both a bit at the time to get a snug fit.

## Tuning the tension

General rule of thumb - the tightest that runs well. There shuld be some back pressure when clicking together. But not much more than the weight of the hotend.

When clicking together, both bolts should contact the bearings simultaneously. Them being off too much will cause some unwanted twisting loads. I have not paid much attention to getting this exactly right and have not had any problems.

Final step - add a drop of CA glue at the base for the scew head to lock it in place.

## Tension and temperature

Chamber temperature has effect on the tension. Generally less tension at higher temps.

* ASA: The tension will lessen with higher chamber temps, but return to previous level on cooldown.
